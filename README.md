Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates customized financial plans for its customers that include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations by sing a RESTful API to help bolster security. Artemis Financial wants for Global Rain to protect the organization from external threats.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I believe I did well at generating the vulnerability reports and analyzing them. A lot of the vulnerabilities were able to be resolved by updating systems like Spring Boot and Tomcat. Secure coding is essential in order to protect all parties data and information. If a company does not have secure databases and programs, then attacks can happen where customer data may be leaked which could in turn affect the reputation of the organization.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Figuring out some of the high level vulnerabilites and translating what they meant was the hardest part for me. However having access to the Vulnerability report which had links that helped to describe the vulnerabilities was helpful. 
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Cipher algorithms, secure hash algorithms, and a serverController were all used to help add layers of security. A self-signed certificate was also generated in order to allow the server to connect to the client securely. 
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Unfortunately I was unable to make the server secure, even after editing the application.properties file and generating the self signed certificate. 
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The resources from Oracle on the cipher algorithms and security best standards will be utilized in future projects. 
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Generating the vulnerability report and analyzing it is one of the examples I would use to show future employers.
